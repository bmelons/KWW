Hello and welcome!

Includes 10 spritesheets for snappy explosion animations. Each has 16 frames in a 4x4 grid. If you need individual images instead of a sheet, google a "spritesheet cutter tool" to separate them apart automatically.

Format: 
PNG with transparency

Image Sizes: 
128px - aka 32x32px per frame
or 
256px - aka 64x64px per frame

Use them with particle effects, sprite animations, cartoons, game projects, generative art or any other artistic endeavours!
